    "- Une API est une interface qui permet à un programme d’accéder aux fonctionnalités ou aux données d’un autre service, sans avoir besoin de connaître son fonctionnement interne.\n",
    "- Exemple : l’API Google Books met à disposition des données sur des millions de livres, que l’on peut interroger depuis un programme Python.\n",

When did \\\"cuisine\\\" become a concept and how did we come to judge food by its method of preparation, manner of consumption, and gastronomic merit? Food: A Culinary History explores culinary evolution and eating habits from prehistoric times to the present, offering surprising insights into our social and agricultural practices, religious beliefs, and most unreflected habits. The volume dispels myths such as the tale that Marco Polo brought pasta to Europe from China, that the original recipe for chocolate contained chili instead of sugar, and more. As it builds its history, the text also reveals the dietary rules of the ancient Hebrews, the contributions of Arabic cookery to European cuisine, the table etiquette of the Middle Ages, and the evolution of beverage styles in early America. It concludes with a discussion on the McDonaldization of food and growing popularity of foreign foods today.\",\n",

For its twentieth anniversary, Harold McGee prepared a new, fully revised and updated edition of On Food and Cooking. He has rewritten the text almost completely, expanded it by two-thirds, and commissioned more than 100 new illustrations. As compulsively readable and engaging as ever, the new On Food and Cooking provides countless eye-opening insights into food, its preparation, and its enjoyment. On Food and Cooking pioneered the translation of technical food science into cook-friendly kitchen science and helped birth the inventive culinary movement known as \\\"molecular gastronomy.\\\" Though other books have been written about kitchen science, On Food and Cooking remains unmatched in the accuracy, clarity, and thoroughness of its explanations, and the intriguing way in which it blends science with the historical evolution of foods and cooking techniques. Among the major themes addressed throughout the new edition are: \\u00b7 Traditional and modern methods of food production and their influences on food quality \\u00b7 The great diversity of methods by which people in different places and times have prepared the same ingredients \\u00b7 Tips for selecting the best ingredients and preparing them successfully \\u00b7 The particular substances that give foods their flavors, and that give us pleasure \\u00b7 Our evolving knowledge of the health benefits and risks of foods On Food and Cooking is an invaluable and monumental compendium of basic information about ingredients, cooking methods, and the pleasures of eating. It will delight and fascinate anyone who has ever cooked, savored, or wondered about food.\",\n",

What should we eat? How do we know it is safe? How should food be distributed? What is good food? David M. Kaplan\\u2019s erudite and informative introduction grounds the discussion, showing how philosophers since Plato have taken up questions about food, diet, agriculture, and animals. However, until recently, few have considered food a standard subject for serious philosophical debate. Each of the essays in this book brings in-depth analysis to many contemporary debates in food studies\\u2014Slow Food, sustainability, food safety, and politics\\u2014and addresses such issues as \\\"happy meat,\\\" aquaculture, veganism, and table manners. The result is an extraordinary resource that guides readers to think more clearly and responsibly about what we consume and how we provide for ourselves, and illuminates the reasons why we act as we do.\",\n",

      "        \"description\": \"Consumers have the right to know what is in the food they are eating, and accordingly, a number of global food regulations require that the provenance of the food can be guaranteed from farm to fork. Many different instrumental techniques have been proposed for food authentication. Although traditional methods are still being used, new approaches such as genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics are helping to complement existing methodologies for verifying the claims made about certain food products. During the last decade, proteomics (the largescale analysis of proteins in a particular biological system at a particular time) has been applied to different research areas within food technology. Since proteins can be used as markers for many properties of a food, even indicating processes to which the food has been subjected, they can provide further evidence of the foods labeling claim. Proteomics for Food Authentication, a volume in the Food Analysis and Properties Series, is a comprehensive and updated overview of the applications, drawbacks, advantages, and challenges of proteomics for food authentication. Features: Provides a comprehensive and critical overview of the application of proteomics in food Helps food scientists determine the authenticity of several food products Provides applied techniques for both laboratory and industrial environments Describes workflows, technologies, and tools that are being assessed in proteomics-related studies Workflows, technologies, and tools that are being assessed in proteomics-related studies are described, followed by a review of the specific applications regarding food authenticity and, now and then, food quality. The book will provide a comprehensive and critical overview of the application of proteomics approaches to determine the authenticity of several food products updating the performances and current limitations of the applied techniques in both laboratory and industrial environments. As such it is well suited to food scientist, chemical engineers, food engineers, research labs, universities, governments, related food industries.

In more than one-third of these households, the food intake of some household members was reduced and normal eating patterns were disrupted due to limited resources. The Workshop on Understanding the Relationship Between Food Insecurity and Obesity was held to explore the biological, economic, psychosocial, and other factors that may influence the relationship between food insecurity, overweight, and obesity in the United States. Hunger and Obesity examines current concepts and research findings in the field. The report identifies information gaps, proposes alternative approaches to analyzing data, recommends new data that should be collected, and addresses the limitations of the available research.\",\n",

A Dictionary of Japanese Food helps food lovers around the world decipher the intricacies and nuances of Japanese cooking and its ingredients. Definitions in ordinary cookbooks and standard dictionaries--such as akebia for akebi, sea cucumber for namako, plum for ume--can be inadequate, misleading, or just plain wrong. Richard Hoskings eliminates the mystery by ensuring that each entry in the Japanese-English section includes the Japanese term in Roman script; the term in kana or kanji or both; a Latin name where appropriate; an English definition; and, for most entries, a short annotation. The English-Japanese section defines important English food terms in Japanese and annotates those needing explanation. One hundred small line drawings make it easy for readers to identify everything from mitsuba to the okoze fish, and seventeen appendices address the most critical elements of Japanese cuisine, from the making of miso and the structure of the Japanese meal to the tea ceremony. Newly typeset and featuring a fascinating and informative new foreword by Japanese cookbook author Debra Samuel, A Dictionary of Japanese Food will continue to help both food lovers and visitors to Japan discover the wonders of one of the world's great cuisines.\",\n",

The second edition was intended to cover almost all of the species likely to be encountered in mainstream food supplies, and only a few additional species have been included in this new edition. The third edition represents primarily an updating \\u2013 of taxonomy, physiology, mycotoxin production and ecology. Changes in taxonomy reflect the impact that molecular methods have had on our understanding of classification but, it must be said, have not radically altered the overall picture. The improvements in the understanding of the physiology of food spoilage fungi have been relatively small, reflecting perhaps the lack of emphasis on physiology in modern mic- biological science. Much remains to be understood about the specificity of particular fungi for particular substrates, of the influence of water activity on the growth of many of the species treated, and even on such basic parameters as cardinal temperatures for growth and the influence of pH and preservatives. Since 1997, a great deal has been learnt about the specificity of mycotoxin production and in which commodities and products-specific mycotoxins are likely to occur. Changes in our understanding of the ecology of the included species are also in most cases evolutionary. A great number of papers have been published on the ecology of foodborne fungi in the past few years, but with few exceptions the basic ecology of the included species remains.\",\n",

For the most part filmmakers have settled on three basic ways to treat food: as a prop in which the food is usually obscured from sight or ignored by the actors; as a transition device to compress time and help advance the plot; as a symbol or metaphor, or in some other meaningful way, to make a dramatic point or to reveal an aspect of an actor's character, mood or thought process. This hugely expanded and revised edition details 400 food scenes, in addition to the 400 films reviewed for the first edition, and an introduction tracing the technical, artistic and cultural forces that contributed to the emergence of food films as a new genre--originated by such films as Tampopo, Babette's Feast and more recently by films like Mostly Martha, No Reservations and Ratatouille. A filmography is included as an appendix.\",\n",

Then she meets Tomasso, who's handsome, young -- and cooks in the exclusive Templi restaurant. Perfect. Except, unbeknownst to Laura, Tomasso is in fact only a waiter at Templi -- it's his shy friend Bruno who is the chef. But Tomasso is the one who knows how to get the girls, and when Laura comes to dinner he persuades Bruno to help him with the charade. It works: the meal is a sensual feast, Laura is utterly seduced and Tomasso falls in lust. But it is Bruno, the real chef who has secretly prepared every dish Laura has eaten, who falls deeply and unrequitedly in love. A delicious tale of Cyrano de Bergerac-style culinary seduction, but with sensual recipes instead of love poems.\",\n",

We now live in a period of world-wide food crisis, a food saved is a food produced. Food Microbiology explores the fundamental elements affecting the presence, activity, and control of microorganisms in food. The subject also includes the key concepts required to meet the minimum standards for degrees in food science with a wealth of practical information about the most essential factors and principles that affect microorganisms in food. Food microbiology is mainly concern with production of food, beverages, cheese, yogurt, tempeh, kimchi, beer, and wine, etc. with the use of microbes. As most people are aware, microbes can also cause food spoilage. This area of food microbiology is of major economic importance. Microbiology is the science which includes the study of the occurrence and significance of bacteria, fungi, protozoa and algae which are the beginning and ending of intricate food chains upon which all life depends. These food chains begin wherever photosynthetic organisms can trap light energy and use it to synthesize large molecules from carbon dioxide, water and mineral salts forming the proteins, fats and carbohydrates which all other living creatures use for food. Within and on the bodies of all living creatures, as well as in soil and water, micro-organisms build up and change molecules, extracting energy and growth substances. Today food microbiology has become an interesting and challenging subject. The present book covers important main aspects of interaction between microorganisms, food borne illnesses and food fermentations.\",\n",

This volume explores sources of ecologically-based diversity of functional foods and food ingredients that are available to enhance diverse nutritional values and functional benefits of foods for better human health outcomes, especially focusing on emerging diet and lifestyle-linked non-communicable chronic disease (NCDs) challenges. The contributors with expertise in the field of Food Biotechnology and Functional Food Ingredients have integrated the recent advances in some common as well as novel sources of functional foods and ingredients from diverse ecological and cultural origins. Further, these chapters also highlight human health relevant bioactive profiles and associated functionalities of these health-promoting compounds, including preventative functional roles for common NCD-linked health benefits. FEATURES: Provides ecological and metabolic rational to integrate novel functional food and functional ingredient sources in wider health-focused food system innovations. Examines the value-added role of select functional foods and food ingredients to improve NCD-linked health benefits such as type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and human gut improvement Includes insights on system-based solutions to advance climate resilient and health focused food diversity based on diverse biotechnological approaches to design and integrate functional food and food ingredient sources Overall, the rationale of this book series is focused on Metabolic-Driven Rationale to Advance Biotechnological Approaches for Functional Foods, the synopsis of which is presented as the Introduction chapter, which is followed by a chapter on current understanding about regulatory guidelines for health claims of functional foods and food ingredients. Special topics on nonnutritive sweeteners, caroteneprotein from seafood waste, and Xylooligosaccharides as functional food ingredients for health-focused dietary applications are integrated in this book. Additionally, ecologically and metabolically-driven functional roles of common food sources such as corn, and barley and some novel food sources, such as ancient emmer wheat, black soybean, fava bean, herbs from Lamiaceae and functional protein ingredients and minerals from Lemnaceae are also highlighted in this volume. The overall goal is to provide insights on role of these functional food and ingredient sources for their integration in wider health-focused food systems, which will help food scientists, food industry personnel, nutritionists, crop science researchers, public health professionals, and policy makers to make appropriate decisions and to formulate strategies for improving health and well-being. A related book focuses on biological and metabolically driven mobilization of functional bioactives and ingredients and their analysis that is relevant in health and wellness.\",\n",

No other book available to food scientists provides detailed coverage of the ingredients, processes, products, and equipment of nearly every type of snack food made today. Since publication of the First Edition, many changes have occurred in the snack industry, making necessary a thorough revision of all chapters. The text, illustrations, and bibliographies have all been brought up-to-date. My goal has been to provide an accurate and reasona bly detailed description of every major snack processing method and prod uct current in the United States. If any reader believes I have omitted an important topic, I would be glad to learn ofit, in the hope that there will be a Third Edition in which I can incorporate the suggested additions. One of the main purposes of this volume is to provide a source for answers to problems that the technologist encounters in the course of his or her daily work. Extensive bibliographies, in which the emphasis is on recent publications (extending into 1983), should permit the reader to resolve more complex or new questions. With these bibliographies as guides, the food technologist can delve as deeply as he or she wishes into specialized aspects ofthe subject, while at the same time the reader who is interested in the broad overall picture will not be distracted by excess detail.\",\n",

Guiding us around the philosopher\\u2019s banquet table with erudition, wit, and irreverence, Michel Onfray offers surprising insights on foods ranging from fillet of cod to barley soup, from sausage to wine and coffee. Tracing the edible obsessions of philosophers from Diogenes to Sartre, Onfray considers how their ideas relate to their diets. Would Diogenes have been an opponent of civilization without his taste for raw octopus? Would Rousseau have been such a proponent of frugality if his daily menu had included something more than dairy products? Onfray offers a perfectly Kantian critique of the nose and palate, since \\u201cthe idea obtained from them is more a representation of enjoyment than cognition of the external object.\\u201d He exposes Nietzsche\\u2019s grumpiness\\u2014really, Nietzsche grumpy?\\u2014about bad cooks and the retardation of human evolution, and he explores Sartre\\u2019s surrealist repulsion by shellfish because they are \\u201cfood buried in an object, and you have to pry them out.\\u201d A fun romp through the culinary likes and dislikes of our most famous thinkers, Appetites for Thought will intrigue, provoke, and entertain, and it might also make you ponder a bite to eat.\",\n",

Advances in food processing continue to take place as food scientists and food engineers adapt to the challenges imposed by emerging pathogens, environmental concerns, shelf life, quality and safety, as well as the dietary needs and demands of humans. In addition to covering food processing principles that have long been essential to food quality and safety, this edition of Food Processing: Principles and Applications, unlike the former edition, covers microbial/enzyme inactivation kinetics, alternative food processing technologies as well as environmental and sustainability issues currently facing the food processing industry. The book is divided into two sections, the first focusing on principles of food processing and handling, and the second on processing technologies and applications. As a hands-on guide to the essential processing principles and their applications, covering the theoretical and applied aspects of food processing in one accessible volume, this book is a valuable tool for food industry professionals across all manufacturing sectors, and serves as a relevant primary or supplemental text for students of food science.\",\n",

He explores how food helps us understand what it means to be human. The centrality of food in life, and the importance of food as life, is undeniable. As a source of biological substrates, personal pleasure and political power, food is and has been an enduring requirement of human biological, social and cultural existence. In recent years, interest in food has increased across the academic, public and popular spheres, fuelled by popular media\\u2019s constant play on the role of food and body size, and food and cooking, as a mass spectacle for TV audiences. Through food, we construct our social identities, our families and communities. However, Coveney also highlights the tensions between the industrialisation of food, the environment, and the iniquitous distribution of food. He also considers how the food industries, on which most of us must rely, have also had direct effects on our bodies through diet, and the development of illness and diseases. This accessible primer is for students and general readers alike, indeed, for anyone with an interest in food. It questions the idea that food is merely something inert on the plate. Instead, it shows how influential, symbolic, powerful and transformative food has come to be.\",\n",

John Brueggemann interviewed dozens of farmers, chefs, non-profit managers, consumers, teachers, and healthcare providers. He argues that their individual stories point towards larger patterns that have shaped the alternative agro-food movement, and that other factors, including the environmental movement, farms, lifestyle movements, and consumers have all played a crucial role in its rise. The author concludes that the alternative agro-food movement is providing a countervailing force relative to mainstream market culture, and that instead of efficiency, profit, consumption, individualism and short-term thinking, the alternative agro-food movement emphasizes meaning, need, creation, community, and long-term thinking.\",\n",

Despite a renaissance in British home cooking, coupled with a rediscovery of local produce through farmers' markets and enthusiastic celebrity chefs, many of us are missing some pretty crucial information. I mean, what's the use of a fancy gooseberry recipe in November? You want to know what's good to eat now? And why? Without pouring through stacks of recipe books? You need this book. Seasonal Food is organized into twelve chapters, one for each month of the year. Each chapter starts with a brief story about the month itself (what's happening in the farming calendar, food-related customs and traditions), followed by narrative sections covering what's in prime season - fruit and veg, meat, fish and other seasonally-influenced produce such as cheeses. There are recipes with information such as traditions, best regions etc and other basic suggestions about preparation. And new for this edition and in response to a growing sophistication in seasonal eating in the UK, it features gourmet foods that you can't source locally. Discover when to get the finest nectarines or the best month to treat yourself to Vacherin cheese.\",\n",

The properties ofdifferent enzymes are linked to the physical and biochemical eventsthat they influence in food materials and products, while these inturn are related to the key organoleptic, sensory and shelf lifequalities of foods. Fully updated to reflect advances made in the field over recentyears, new chapters in the second edition look at the use ofenzymes in the reduction of acrylamide, in fish processing and innon-bread cereal applications such as flour confectionery. Geneticmodification of source organisms (GMO) has been used to improveyields of purer enzymes for some time now but the newer technologyof protein engineering (PE) of enzymes has the potential to producepurer, more targeted products without unwanted side activities, anda chapter is also included on this important new topic. Authorshave been selected not only for their practical working knowledgeof enzymes but also for their infectious enthusiasm for thesubject.

Why did we begin using individual plates and utensils to eat? When did \"cuisine\" become a concept and how did we come to judge food by its method of preparation, manner of consumption, and gastronomic merit? Food: A Culinary History explores culinary evolution and eating habits from prehistoric times to the present, offering surprising insights into our social and agricultural practices, religious beliefs, and most unreflected habits. The volume dispels myths such as the tale that Marco Polo brought pasta to Europe from China, that the original recipe for chocolate contained chili instead of sugar, and more. As it builds its history, the text also reveals the dietary rules of the ancient Hebrews, the contributions of Arabic cookery to European cuisine, the table etiquette of the Middle Ages, and the evolution of beverage styles in early America. It concludes with a discussion on the McDonaldization of food and growing popularity of foreign foods today.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780231544092'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '023154409X'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 644, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Cooking'], 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': True, 'contentVersion': '1.11.9.0.preview.2', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sa6pDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sa6pDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.fr/books?id=sa6pDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=food&hl=&as_brr=5&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=1&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sa6pDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sa6pDAAAQBAJ'}, 'saleInfo': {'country': 'FR', 'saleability': 'FOR_SALE', 'isEbook': True, 'listPrice': {'amount': 24.99, 'currencyCode': 'EUR'}, 'retailPrice': {'amount': 17.49, 'currencyCode': 'EUR'}, 'buyLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sa6pDAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-sa6pDAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api', 'offers': [{'finskyOfferType': 1, 'listPrice': {'amountInMicros': 24990000, 'currencyCode': 'EUR'}, 'retailPrice': {'amountInMicros': 17490000, 'currencyCode': 'EUR'}, 'giftable': True}]}, 'accessInfo': {'country': 'FR', 'viewability': 'PARTIAL', 'embeddable': True, 'publicDomain': False, 'textToSpeechPermission': 'ALLOWED', 'epub': {'isAvailable': True, 'acsTokenLink': 'http://books.google.fr/books/download/Food-sample-epub.acsm?id=sa6pDAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api'}, 'pdf': {'isAvailable': False}, 'webReaderLink': 'http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=sa6pDAAAQBAJ&hl=&as_brr=5&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api', 'accessViewStatus': 'SAMPLE', 'quoteSharingAllowed': False}, 'searchInfo': {'textSnippet': 'The volume dispels myths such as the tale that Marco Polo brought pasta to Europe from China, that the original recipe for chocolate contained chili instead of sugar, and more.'}}\n",
